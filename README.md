## 📝 Notes

### Unit Tests

The project includes unit tests that verify the following test cases:

- `33#` → `E`
- `227*#` → `B`
- `4433555 555666#` → `HELLO`
- `8 88777444666*664#` → `TURING`

### Additional Feature

While not required by the assignment, I implemented a cycling mechanism for letter selection. This means that if you press a key more times than it has letters (e.g., pressing 2 four times), it will cycle back to the beginning of the letter sequence.

## 📝 Input Format

- Use numbers 2-9 to represent letters
- Use `*` for backspace
- Use 0 for word separation
- End your sequence with `#`
